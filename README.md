Found a old Macromedia Director Game I made at Uni!!

I had to rush it to meet a deadline, there was so much I want to keep doing to it, but I never got around to it, then Abobe bought Macromedia and the rest is history.

I still have the project file (.dir) so if anybody has an old working copy of Macromedia Director (or knows who I could open, work in it) Please let me know!!!
